#### Kubernetes
What is K8s: container orchestration service.

Kuberntes manages a Cluster. Clusters are made by Nodes that contain Pods, which can contain one or more containers.

#### Basic Example
Basic example of a ```yaml``` file deploying a K8s cluster.
Here we are just fetching 1 image and asking to have the service at port 80.
```
version: '3.3'

services:
  web:
    image: dockersamples/k8s-wordsmith-web
    ports:
    - "80:80"

words:
  image: dockersamples/k8s-wordsmith-api
  deploy:
    replicas: 5
    endpoint_mode: dnsrr
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 50M
      reservations:
        memory: 50M
db:
  image: dockersamples/k8s-wordsmith-db
```
Can be deployed with ```docker stack deploy ...```

##### Autoscaling is Kubernetes killer feature

### Deploy App to GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
1. Setup GKE
2. Run ```gcloud container cluster create ...```
3. Once the service has been provisioned, I can run app
4. Run by ```kubectl create deployment ... $point to container$```
5. Execute by ```kubectl espose deployment ... --port $PORT_NUMBER$```
6. Overview of situation with ```kubectl get service```, once the service is ready, I can access the service at the port requested.
7. Lastly, I can delete cluster with ```gcloud container cluster delete ...```

#### run_kubernetes.sh
Put all in a single bash script.
Set a docker path for the local deployment.
```kubectl``` is as usual the K8s API.
Run app and forward port to the host.
```kubectl get pods``` to list available pods.
Run command with ```./run_kubernetes.sh```
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

dockerpath="noahgift/flasksklearn"

# Run in Docker Hub container with kubernetes
kubectl run flaskskearlndemo\
    --generator=run-pod/v1\
    --image=$dockerpath\
    --port=80 --labels app=flaskskearlndemo

# List kubernetes pods
kubectl get pods

# Forward the container port to host
kubectl port-forward flaskskearlndemo 8000:80
```

### Deploying a Kubernetes Python Flask App
A Kubernetes Hello World Project for Python Flask.

##### Assets in Repo

* `Makefile`:  [Builds project]
* `Dockerfile`:  [Container configuration]
* `app.py`:  [Flask app]
* `kube-hello-change.yaml`: [Kubernetes YAML Config]

##### Get Started
* Create Python virtual environment `python3 -m venv ~/.kube-hello && source ~/.kube-hello/bin/activate`

* Run `make all` to install python libraries, lint project, including `Dockerfile` and run tests

##### Build and Run Docker Container
* To build the image locally do the following: `docker build -t flask-change:latest .` or run `make build` which has the same command.

* To run do the following:  `docker run -p 8080:8080 flask-change` or run `make run` which has the same command

* In a separate terminal invoke the web service via `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/change/1/34`, or run `make invoke` which has the same command 

* Stop the running docker container by using `control-c` command

##### Running Kubernetes Locally

* Verify Kubernetes is working via docker-desktop context

```bash
(.kube-hello) âžœ  kubernetes-hello-world-python-flask git:(main) kubectl get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    master   30d   v1.19.3
```
* Run the application in Kubernetes using the following command which tells Kubernetes to setup the load balanced service and run it:  `kubectl apply -f kube-hello-change.yaml` or run `make run-kube` which has the same command

You can see from the config file that a load-balancer along with three nodes is the configured application.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-flask-change-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: hello-python
  ports:
  - protocol: "TCP"
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-python
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-python
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-python
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-change
        image: flask-change:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

* Verify the container is running: `kubectl get pods`

* Describe the load balanced service: `kubectl describe services hello-python-service`

* Invoke the endpoint to curl it:  `make invoke`

* To cleanup the deployment do the following: `kubectl delete deployment hello-python`
