### DevOps
DevOps is the combination of practices and tools designed to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services faster than traditional software development processes.
Advantages: speed, delivery, realiability, scale, collaboration, security.

##### Best practices
1. Continuos Integration - automatically test code
2. Continuos Delivery - automatically build code in a testing environment
3. Microservices - they make up the bigger picture of the developed software, break down problem by smaller services that talk between each other
4. Infrastructure as Code - to build the whole infrastructure
5. Version Control - done with Git
6. Agile planning - Jira

### Infrastructure as Code
It is code that deploys infrastructure and lets you provision infrastructure from the cloud.
